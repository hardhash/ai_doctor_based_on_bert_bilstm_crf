This project includes online part and offline part
In offline part, we want to train models to make NER job. We have 2 kinds of data, one is regular short text, one is irregular data. We want to make sure 
if the sentence user sent concludes the main disease data. eg. "It's a nice day, but I have a headache"ï¼Œ only headache is a key symptom.
In online part, we want to ask the user what kind of disease he/she may have through their symptom by Neo4j and redis.
